**Important Update**

Backtrader is a flexible and powerful backtesting engine written in python.
The original project found wide appeal due to its versatility. Over time however,
the original code base became inaccessible to bug fixes and enhancements.

Backtrader2 is a forked copy of backtrader by the community of users that seeks to make
backtrader an ongoing project.

Initially backtrader2 will fix bugs. Just submit an issue and pull requests.

New code ideas are welcome but will not be addressed at this time. But please do enter them as an issue
and tag it with 'enhancement' so that we can track your idea down the road.

**Backtrader's back and we look forward to its future!**

For feedback/questions/... use the `Community <https://community.backtrader.com>`_

Here a snippet of a Simple Moving Average CrossOver. It can be done in several
different ways. Use the docs (and examples) Luke!
::

  from datetime import datetime
  import backtrader as bt

  class SmaCross(bt.SignalStrategy):
      def __init__(self):
          sma1, sma2 = bt.ind.SMA(period=10), bt.ind.SMA(period=30)
          crossover = bt.ind.CrossOver(sma1, sma2)
          self.signal_add(bt.SIGNAL_LONG, crossover)

  cerebro = bt.Cerebro()
  cerebro.addstrategy(SmaCross)

  data0 = bt.feeds.YahooFinanceData(dataname='MSFT', fromdate=datetime(2011, 1, 1),
                                    todate=datetime(2012, 12, 31))
  cerebro.adddata(data0)

  cerebro.run()
  cerebro.plot()

Including a full featured chart. Give it a try! This is included in the samples
as ``sigsmacross/sigsmacross2.py``. Along it is ``sigsmacross.py`` which can be
parametrized from the command line.

Features:
=========

Live Trading and backtesting platform written in Python.

  - Live Data Feed and Trading with

    - Interactive Brokers (needs ``IbPy`` and benefits greatly from an
      installed ``pytz``)
    - *Visual Chart* (needs a fork of ``comtypes`` until a pull request is
      integrated in the release and benefits from ``pytz``)
    - *Oanda* (needs ``oandapy``) (REST API Only - v20 did not support
      streaming when implemented)

  - Data feeds from csv/files, online sources or from *pandas* and *blaze*
  - Filters for datas, like breaking a daily bar into chunks to simulate
    intraday or working with Renko bricks
  - Multiple data feeds and multiple strategies supported
  - Multiple timeframes at once
  - Integrated Resampling and Replaying
  - Step by Step backtesting or at once (except in the evaluation of the Strategy)
  - Integrated battery of indicators
  - *TA-Lib* indicator support (needs python *ta-lib* / check the docs)
  - Easy development of custom indicators
  - Analyzers (for example: TimeReturn, Sharpe Ratio, SQN) and ``pyfolio``
    integration (**deprecated**)
  - Flexible definition of commission schemes
  - Integrated broker simulation with *Market*, *Close*, *Limit*, *Stop*,
    *StopLimit*, *StopTrail*, *StopTrailLimit*and *OCO* orders, bracket order,
    slippage, volume filling strategies and continuous cash adjustmet for
    future-like instruments
  - Sizers for automated staking
  - Cheat-on-Close and Cheat-on-Open modes
  - Schedulers
  - Trading Calendars
  - Plotting (requires matplotlib)

Documentation
=============

The blog:

  - `Blog <http://www.backtrader.com/blog>`_

Read the full documentation at:

  - `Documentation <http://www.backtrader.com/docu>`_

List of built-in Indicators (122)

  - `Indicators Reference <http://www.backtrader.com/docu/indautoref.html>`_

Python 2/3 Support
==================

  - Python >= ``3.2``

  - It also works with ``pypy`` and ``pypy3`` (no plotting - ``matplotlib`` is
    not supported under *pypy*)

Installation
============

``backtrader`` is self-contained with no external dependencies (except if you
want to plot)

Install the latest version from the backtrader2 repository:

  - ``pip install git+https://github.com/backtrader2/backtrader``

Or install the original version of ``backtrader`` from *pypi*:

  - ``pip install backtrader``

  - ``pip install backtrader[plotting]``

    If ``matplotlib`` is not installed and you wish to do some plotting

.. note:: The minimum matplotlib version is ``1.4.1``

An example for *IB* Data Feeds/Trading:

  - ``IbPy`` doesn't seem to be in PyPi. Do either::

      pip install git+https://github.com/blampe/IbPy.git

    or (if ``git`` is not available in your system)::

      pip install https://github.com/blampe/IbPy/archive/master.zip

For other functionalities like: ``Visual Chart``, ``Oanda``, ``TA-Lib``, check
the dependencies in the documentation.

From source:

  - Place the *backtrader* directory found in the sources inside your project

Version numbering
=================

X.Y.Z.I

  - X: Major version number. Should stay stable unless something big is changed
    like an overhaul to use ``numpy``
  - Y: Minor version number. To be changed upon adding a complete new feature or
    (god forbids) an incompatible API change.
  - Z: Revision version number. To be changed for documentation updates, small
    changes, small bug fixes
  - I: Number of Indicators already built into the platform
