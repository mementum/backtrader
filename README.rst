Version numbering
=================

X.Y.Z.I

  - X: Major version number. Should stay stable unless something big is changed like an
    overhaul to use numpy
  - Y: Minor version number. To be changed upon adding a complete new feature or
    (god forbids) an incompatible API change.
  - Z: Revision version number. To be changed for documentation updates, small
    changes, small bug fixes
  - I: Number of Indicators already built into the platform

Alternatives
============

If after seeing the docs (see also the example below) you feel this is not your
cup of tea, you can always have a look at similar Python platforms:

  - `PyAlgoTrade <https://github.com/gbeced/pyalgotrade>`_
  - `Zipline <https://github.com/quantopian/zipline>`_
  - `Ultra-Finance <https://code.google.com/p/ultra-finance/>`_
  - `ProfitPy <https://code.google.com/p/profitpy/>`_
  - `pybacktest <https://github.com/ematvey/pybacktest>`_
  - `prophet <https://github.com/Emsu/prophet>`_
  - `quant <https://github.com/maihde/quant>`_
  - `AlephNull <https://github.com/CarterBain/AlephNull>`_
  - `bt <http://pmorissette.github.io/bt/index.html>`_

     ``bt`` slightly pre-dates ``backtrader`` and has a completely different
     approach but it is funny I chose *bt* as the abbreviation for
     ``backtrader`` during imports and that some of the methods have the same
     naming (obvious naming anyhow): "run, plot ..."
