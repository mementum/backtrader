    Keeps track of the life of an trade: size, price,
    commission (and value?)

    An trade starts at 0 can be increased and reduced and can
    be considered closed if it goes back to 0.

    The trade can be long (positive size) or short (negative size)

    An trade is not meant to be reversed (no support in the logic for it)

    Member Attributes:
      - size (int): current size of the trade
      - price (float): current price of the trade
      - value (float): current value of the trade
      - commission (float): current accumulated commission
      - pnl (float): current profit and loss of the trade (gross pnl)
      - pnlcomm (float):
        current profit and loss of the trade minus commission (net pnl)
      - isclosed (bool):
        records if the last update closed (set size to null the trade
      - isopen (bool): records if any update has opened the trade
      - justopened (bool): if the trade was just opened
      - baropen (int): bar in which this trade was opened
      - barclose (int): bar in which this trade was closed
