class Position(object):
    '''
    Keeps and updates the size and price of a position. The object has no
    relationship to any asset. It only keeps size and price.

    Member Attributes:
      - size (int): current size of the position
      - price (float): current price of the position

    The Position instances can be tested using len(position) to see if size
    is not null

    User Methods:

      - __len__: invoking len on the instance position indicates if size is
        not null
    '''

    def __init__(self, size=0, price=0.0):
        self.size = size
        self.price = price

        self.adjbase = None

    def __len__(self):
        return self.size != 0

    def clone(self):
        return Position(size=self.size, price=self.price)

    def pseudoupdate(self, size, price):
        return Position(self.size, self.price).update(size, price)

    def update(self, size, price):
        '''
        Updates the current position and returns the updated size, price and
        units used to open/close a position

        Args:
            size (int): amount to update the position size
                size < 0: A sell operation has taken place
                size > 0: A buy operation has taken place

            price (float):
                Must always be positive to ensure consistency

        Returns:
            A tuple (non-named) contaning
               size - new position size
                   Simply the sum of the existing size plus the "size" argument
               price - new position price
                   If a position is increased the new average price will be
                   returned
                   If a position is reduced the price of the reamining size
                   does not chance
                   If a position is closed the price is nullified
                   If a position is reversed the price is the price given as
                   argument
               opened - amount of contracts from argument "size" that were used
                   to open/increase a position.
                   A position can be opened from 0 or can be a reversal.
                   If a reversal is performed then opened is less than "size",
                   because part of "size" will have been used to close the
                   existing position
               closed - amount of units from arguments "size" that were used to
                   close/reduce a position

            Both opened and closed carry the same sign as the "size" argument
            because they refer to a part of the "size" argument
