class DaySplitter_Close(bt.with_metaclass(bt.MetaParams, object)):
    '''
    Splits a daily bar in two parts simulating 2 ticks which will be used to
    replay the data:

      - First tick: ``OHLX``

        The ``Close`` will be replaced by the *average* of ``Open``, ``High``
        and ``Low``

        The session opening time is used for this tick

      and

      - Second tick: ``CCCC``

        The ``Close`` price will be used for the four components of the price

        The session closing time is used for this tick

    The volume will be split amongst the 2 ticks using the parameters:

      - ``closevol`` (default: ``0.5``) The value indicate which percentage, in
        absolute terms from 0.0 to 1.0, has to be assigned to the *closing*
        tick. The rest will be assigned to the ``OHLX`` tick.

    **This filter is meant to be used together with** ``cerebro.replaydata``
