    '''CommissionInfo

    This class tries to cover commision schemes for elements which have a cost
    based on price * size (ex: acquiring stocks and later selling them) and
    other things like futures in which the cost of an operation is determined
    by the needed cash margin.

    It also calculates the cash adjustment which is performed on a daily basis
    with futures.

    Params:
      - commission: % of fixed per element commission in monetary units
      - mult: multiplier for futures-like operations
      - margin: amount of cash needed for each futures like contracts

    Note:
      `margin` is the key parameter to decide if a commision is calculate for a
      futures-like object or for a stocks like.

      If margin evaluates to "False" (0, 0.0, None, ...) commissions will be
      calculated for stock like objects.

      Otherwise the calculated commissions and cash adjustments will be done
      for futures-like objects
