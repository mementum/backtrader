    Awesome Oscillator (AO) is a momentum indicator reflecting the precise
    changes in the market driving force which helps to identify the trendâ€™s
    strength up to the points of formation and reversal.


    Formula:
     - MEDIAN PRICE = (HIGH+LOW)/2
     - AO = SMA(MEDIAN PRICE, 5)-SMA(MEDIAN PRICE, 34)
