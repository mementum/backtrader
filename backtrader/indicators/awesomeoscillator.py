    Awesome Oscillator (AO) is a momentum indicator reflecting the precise
    changes in the market driving force which helps to identify the trendâ€™s
    strength up to the points of formation and reversal.


    Formula:
     - median price = (high + low) / 2
     - AO = SMA(median price, 5)- SMA(median price, 34)
