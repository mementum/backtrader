Mixing Timeframes in Indicators
###############################

`Release 1.3.0.92
<https://github.com/mementum/backtrader/releases/tag/1.3.0.92>`_ brings up the
possibility to have data (from either data feeds and/or indicators) from
different timeframes mixed.

Background: *Indicators are smart dumb objects.*

  - They are smart because they can make complex calculations.

  - They are dumb because they operate with no knowledge of what sources are
    providing the data for the calculations

As such:

  - If the data sources providing the values have different timeframes,
    different lengths inside the ``Cerebro`` engine, the indicator will break.

Example of a calculation, in which ``data0`` has a timeframe of days and
``data1`` has a timeframe of ``months``::

  pivotpoint = btind.PivotPoint(self.data1)
  sellsignal = self.data0.close < pivotpoint.s1

Here a *sell signal* is sought when the close is below the ``s1`` line (*1st
support*)

.. note:: ``PivotPoint`` works in a larger timeframe by definition

This will in the past with the following error::

  return self.array[self.idx + ago]
  IndexError: array index out of range

And for a good reason: ``self.data.close`` provides values from the very 1st
instant, but ``PivotPoint`` (and hence the ``s1`` line) will only deliver
values once a **full month** has gone by, which is roughly equivalent to 22
values of ``self.data0.close``. During this 22 *closes* there isn't yet a value
for ``s1`` and the attempt to fetch it from the underlying array fails.

*Lines* objects support the ``(ago)`` operator (``__call__`` special method in
*Python*) for deliver a delayed version of itself::

  close1 = self.data.close(-1)

In this example the object ``close1`` (when accessed via ``[0]``) always contains
the previous value (``-1``) delivered by ``close``. The syntax has been
reused to accomodate adapting timeframes. Let's rewrite the above
``pivotpoint`` snippet::

  pivotpoint = btind.PivotPoint(self.data1)
  sellsignal = self.data0.close < pivotpoint.s1()

See how the ``()`` is executed with no arguments (in the background a ``None``
is being supplied). The following is happening:

  ``pivotpoint.s1()`` is returning an internal ``LinesCoupler`` object which
  follows the rhythm of the larger scope. This coupler fills itself with the
  latest delivered value from the real ``s1`` (starting with a default value of
  ``NaN``)

But something extra is needed to make the magic work. ``Cerebro`` has to be
created with::

  cerebro = bt.Cerebro(runonce=False)

or executed with::

  cerebro.run(runonce=False)

In this mode the indicators and late-evaluated automatic *lines* objects are
executed step by step rather than in tight loops. This makes the entire
operation slower, but it makes it **possible**

The sample script at the bottom which was breaking above, now runs::

  $ ./mixing-timeframes.py

With output::

  0021,0021,0001,2005-01-31,2984.75,2935.96,0.00
  0022,0022,0001,2005-02-01,3008.85,2935.96,0.00
  ...
  0073,0073,0003,2005-04-15,3013.89,3010.76,0.00
  0074,0074,0003,2005-04-18,2947.79,3010.76,1.00
  ...

At line 74 the 1st instance of ``close < s1`` takes place.

The script also provides insight into the additional possiblity: *couple all
lines of an indicator*. Before we had::

  self.sellsignal = self.data0.close < pp.s1()

Being the alternative::

  pp1 = pp()
  self.sellsignal = self.data0.close < pp1.s1

Now the entire ``PivotPoint`` indicator has been coupled and any of its lines
can be accessed (namely ``p``, ``r1``, ``r2``, ``s1``, ``s2``). The script has
only interest in ``s1`` and the access is direct.::

  $ ./mixing-timeframes.py --multi

The output::

  0021,0021,0001,2005-01-31,2984.75,2935.96,0.00
  0022,0022,0001,2005-02-01,3008.85,2935.96,0.00
  ...
  0073,0073,0003,2005-04-15,3013.89,3010.76,0.00
  0074,0074,0003,2005-04-18,2947.79,3010.76,1.00
  ...

No surprises here. The same as before. The "coupled" object can even be
plotted::

  $ ./mixing-timeframes.py --multi --plot

Full coupling syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For *lines* objects with multiple lines (for example *Indicators* like
``PivotPoint``):

  - ``obj(clockref=None, line=-1)``

    - ``clockref``
      If ``clockref`` is ``None``, the surrounding object (in the examples a
      ``Strategy``) will be the reference to adapt larger timeframes (for
      example: ``Months``) to smaller/faster timeframes (for example: ``Days``)

      Another reference can be used if desired

    ``line``
      - If the default ``-1`` is given, all *lines* are coupled.
      - If another integer (for example, ``0`` or ``1``) a single line will be
        coupled and fetched by index (from ``obj.lines[x]``)
      - If a string is passed, the line will be fetched by name.

        In the sample, the following could have been done::

          coupled_s1 = pp(line='s1')

For *lines* objects with a single line (for example line ``s1`` from the
indicator ``PivotPoint``):

  - ``obj(clockref=None)`` (see above for ``clockref``)

Conclusion
^^^^^^^^^^

Integrated in the regular ``()`` syntax, data feeds from different timeframes can be
mixed in indicators, always taking into account that ``cerebro`` needs to be
instantiated or created with ``runonce=False``.
