Target Orders
#############

Until version ``1.8.10.96`` smart staking was possible with *backtrader* over
the *Strategy* methods: ``buy`` and ``sell``. It was all about adding a
``Sizer`` to the equation which is responsible for the size of the stake.

What a *Sizer* cannot do is decide if the operation has to be a *buy* or a
*sell*. And that means that a new concept is needed in which a small
intelligence layer is added to make such decision.

Here is where the family of ``order_target_xxx`` methods in the *Strategy* come
into play. Inspired by the ones in ``zipline``, the methods offer the chance to
simply specify the final *target*, be the target:

  - ``size`` -> amount of shares, contracts in the portfolio of a specific
    asset
  - ``value`` -> value in monetary units of the asset in the portfolio
  - ``percent`` -> percentage (from current portfolio) value of the asset in
    the current portfolio

.. note:: The reference for the methods can be found in :doc:`../strategy`. The
	  summary is that the methods use the same *signature* as ``buy`` and
	  ``sell`` except for the parameter ``size`` which is replaced by the
	  parameter ``target``

In this case it is all about specifying the final *target* and the method
decides if an operation will be a *buy* or a *sell*. The same logic applies to
the 3 methods. Let's tart with ``order_target_size``

  - If the *target* is greater than the position a *buy* is issued, with the
    difference ``target - position_size``

    Examples:

      - Pos: ``0``, *target*: ``7`` -> *buy(size=7 - 0)* -> *buy(size=7)*

      - Pos: ``3``, *target*: ``7`` -> *buy(size=7 - 3)* -> *buy(size=4)*

      - Pos: ``-3``, *target*: ``7`` -> *buy(size=7 - -3)* -> *buy(size=10)*

      - Pos: ``-3``, *target*: ``-2`` -> *buy(size=-2 - -3)* -> *buy(size=1)*

  - If the *target* is smaller than the position a *sell* is issued with the
    difference ``position_size - target``

    Examples:

      - Pos: ``0``, *target*: ``-7`` -> *sell(size=0 - -7)* -> *sell(size=7)*

      - Pos: ``3``, *target*: ``-7`` -> *sell(size=3 - -7)* -> *sell(size=10)*

      - Pos: ``-3``, *target*: ``-7`` -> *sell(size=-3 - -7)* -> *sell(size=4)*

      - Pos: ``3``, *target*: ``2`` -> *sell(size=3 - 2)* -> *sell(size=1)*


When targetting a value with ``order_target_value``, the current *value* of the
asset in the portfolio and the *position size* are both taken into account to
decide what the final underlying operation will be. The reasoning:

  - If *position size* is negative (*short*) and the *target value* has to be
    greater than the current value, this means: *sell* more

As such the logic works as follows:

  - If ``target > value`` and ``size >=0`` -> *buy*

  - If ``target > value`` and ``size < 0`` -> *sell*

  - If ``target < value`` and ``size >= 0`` -> *sell*

  - If ``target < value`` and ``size* < 0`` -> *buy*

The logic for ``order_target_percent`` is the same as that of
``order_target_value``. This method simply takes into account the current total
value of the portfolio to determine the *target value* for the asset.


The Sample
**********

*backtrader* tries to have a sample for each new functionality and this is no
exception. No bells and whistles, just something to test the results are as
expected. This one is under the ``order_target`` directory in the samples.

The logic in the sample is rather dumb and only meaant for testing:

  - During *odd months* (Jan, Mar, ...), use the *day* as target (in the case
    of ``order_target_value`` multiplying the day by ``1000``)

    This mimics an increasing *target*

  - During *even months* (Feb, Apr, ...) use ``31 - day`` as the *target*

    This mimics an decreasing *target*

order_target_size
=================

Let's see what happens in *Jan* and *Feb*.
::

  $ ./order_target.py --target-size -- plot
  0001 - 2005-01-03 - Position Size:     00 - Value 1000000.00
  0001 - 2005-01-03 - Order Target Size: 03
  0002 - 2005-01-04 - Position Size:     03 - Value 999994.39
  0002 - 2005-01-04 - Order Target Size: 04
  0003 - 2005-01-05 - Position Size:     04 - Value 999992.48
  0003 - 2005-01-05 - Order Target Size: 05
  0004 - 2005-01-06 - Position Size:     05 - Value 999988.79
  ...
  0020 - 2005-01-31 - Position Size:     28 - Value 999968.70
  0020 - 2005-01-31 - Order Target Size: 31
  0021 - 2005-02-01 - Position Size:     31 - Value 999954.68
  0021 - 2005-02-01 - Order Target Size: 30
  0022 - 2005-02-02 - Position Size:     30 - Value 999979.65
  0022 - 2005-02-02 - Order Target Size: 29
  0023 - 2005-02-03 - Position Size:     29 - Value 999966.33
  0023 - 2005-02-03 - Order Target Size: 28
  ...


In *Jan* the *target* starts at ``3`` with the 1st trading day of the year and
increases. And the *position* size moves initially from ``0`` to ``3`` and then
in increments of ``1``.

Finishing *Jan* the last *order_target* is for ``31`` and that *position size*
is reported when entering the 1st day of *Feb*, when the new *target side* is
requested to be ``30`` and goes changing along with the position in decrements
of `Â´1``.

order_target_value
==================

A similar behavior is expected from *target values*
::

  0021 - 2005-02-01 - Position Size:     880 - Value 998807.33
  0021 - 2005-02-01 - data value 30580.00
  0021 - 2005-02-01 - Order Target Value: 30000.00
  0022 - 2005-02-02 - Position Size:     864 - Value 999510.21
  0022 - 2005-02-02 - data value 30706.56
  0022 - 2005-02-02 - Order Target Value: 29000.00
  0023 - 2005-02-03 - Position Size:     816 - Value 999130.05
  0023 - 2005-02-03 - data value 28633.44
  0023 - 2005-02-03 - Order Target Value: 28000.00
  ...

There is an extra line of information telling what the actual *data value* (in
the portfolio) is. This helps in finding out if the *target value* has been
reachec.

The initial target is ``3000.0`` and the reported initial value is
``2853.24``. The question here is whether this is *close enough*. And the
answer is *Yes*

  - The sample uses a ``Market`` order at the end of a daily bar and the last
    available price to calculate a *target size* which meets the *target value*

  - The execution uses then the ``open`` price of the next day and this is
    unlikely to be the previous ``close``

Doing it in any other way would mean one is *cheating* him/herfself.

The next *target value* and *final value* are much closer: ``4000`` and
``3938.17``.

When changing into *Feb* the *target value* starts decreasing from ``31000`` to
``30000`` and ``29000`. So does the *data value* with from ``30580.00`` to
``30706.56`` and then to ``28633.44``. Wait:

  - ``30580`` -> ``30706.56`` is a positive change

    Indeed. In this case the calculated *size* for the *target value* met an
    *opening price* which bumped the value to ``30706.56``

How this effect can be avoided:

  - The sample uses a ``Market`` type execution for the orders and this effect
    cannot be avoided

  - The methods ``order_target_xxx`` allow specifying the *execution type* and
    *price*.

    One could specify ``Limit`` as the execution order and let the price be the
    *close* price (chosen by the method if nothing else be provided) or even
    provide specific pricing

order_target_percent
==================

In this case it is simply a percentage of the current portfolio value.
