Installation

Requirements and versions
*************************

``backtrader`` is self-contained with no external dependencies (except if you
want to plot)

Basic requirements are:

  - Python 2.7
  - Python 3.2/3.3/3.4/3.5
  - pypy/pypy3

Additional requirements if plotting is wished:

  - Matplotlib >= 1.4.1

    It may work with previous versions, but this the one used for
    development

.. note::
   At the time of writing Matplotlib is not supported under pypy/pypy3

Python 2.x/3.x compatibility
============================

Development takes place under Python 2.7 and sometimes under 3.4. Tests are run
locally with both version.

Compatibility with 3.2/3.3/3.5 and pypy/pyp3 is checked with continuous
integration under Travis

Install from pypi
*****************
For example using pip::

  pip install backtrader

*easy_install* with the same syntax can also be applied

Install from pypi (including *matplotlib*)
******************************************

Use this if plotting capabilities are wished::

  pip install backtrader[matplotlib]

This pulls in matplotlib which will in turn pull in other dependencies.

Again you may prefer (or only have access to ...) *easy_install*

Install from source
*******************

First downloading a release or the latest tarball from the github site:
https://github.com/mementum/backtrader

And the running the command::

  python setup.py install

Run from source in your project
*******************************

Again download a release or the latest tarball from the github site:

  https://github.com/mementum/backtrader

And then copy the *backtrader* package directory to your own project. Under a
Unix-like OS for example::

  tar xzf backgrader.tgz
  cd backtrader
  cp -r backtrader project_directory

Remember that you would then need to manually install ``matplotlib`` for
plotting.
